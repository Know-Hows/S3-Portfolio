# **What is CI-CD?**
CI/CD, short for Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment, automates the building, testing, and deployment of the code. This accelerates the release of new features or fixes while maintaining a stable workflow and code quality.

## **What is CI?**
The acronym CI/CD has a few different meanings. The "CI" in CI/CD always refers to continuous integration, which is an automation process for developers. Successful CI means new code changes to an app are regularly built, tested, and merged to a shared repository. Itâ€™s a solution to the problem of having too many branches of an app in development at once that might conflict with each other.

## **What is CD?**
CI/CD, in software development, stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment. These terms are often used interchangeably but represent related concepts that focus on automating different stages of the software development pipeline.

Continuous delivery involves automating the process of testing and uploading a developer's changes to a code repository, such as GitHub or a container registry. These changes are then made available for deployment to a live production environment by the operations team. Continuous delivery aims to improve communication and visibility between development and business teams, ensuring that deploying new code requires minimal effort.

Continuous deployment, on the other hand, takes automation a step further by automatically releasing a developer's changes from the repository directly to the production environment, where they become accessible to customers. This approach eliminates manual processes that can slow down the delivery of software and builds upon the benefits of continuous delivery.

In summary, CI/CD encompasses both continuous delivery and continuous deployment, with the former automating the process up to the code repository and the latter automating the release of changes to the production environment for customer use. These practices streamline software development, enhance collaboration, and accelerate the delivery of new code.

# **Why we use CI-CD.**
CI/CD automates the process of integrating, releasing, and deploying software while removing traditional roadblocks. It supports the larger goal of agile methodology to accelerate the software development lifecycle, and it supports the DevOps approach of aligning development and operations teams.

![CI-CD](https://github.com/Know-Hows/S3-Portfolio/assets/58418773/c562777a-d7ab-446d-8541-bf446485bb8e)[^3]

In addition to supporting these larger goals, CI/CD enables you to:
- **Ship software quickly and efficiently**: CI/CD pipelines move applications from the coding to deployment phases at scale, ensuring that the pace of development matches the needs of the business.<br></br>
- **Increase productivity**: By implementing automated processes, development and operations teams are no longer spending time merging, building, testing, releasing, and deploying software manually. Instead, they can focus on writing better code and monitoring deployments for issues.<br></br>
- **Reduce risk on delivery**: Testing every change before it's deployed ensures that the result will be a higher quality product and lower the rate of bugs in production. Customers will receive a better product, and the development team will spend less time fixing urgent defects discovered after release.<br></br>
- **Incorporate user feedback faster**: CI/CD removes traditional roadblocks for development and operations teams, enabling the faster release of new features to meet users' needs. This will increase customer satisfaction and provide valuable insights into the capabilities that users value for future projects.<br></br>
- **Standardize processes**: Automating the merge, test, delivery, and deployment processes means that they will always follow the same structure. This standardizes the pipeline, whereas manual execution of these tasks always comes with the risk of human error, such as executing tests in a different order.

# **How we implement CI-CD.**
We implement our CI-CD pipelines with Github Actions, this is a free service provided by Github. In this Workflow you can define when the workflow needs to trigger and starts running the jobs inside it.

## **Individual project**
The CI-CD pipelines in our individual project are based on a C# ASP.NET core API back-end and a JavaScript React with Node.JS front-end.

### **Front-end**
The following images display how we implemented the pipeline to build and run the unit tests while also activating the static code analysis with Sonarcloud.

<br></br>

This image display how we implented of how we made the pipeline to build and push a docker image to docker hub.

<br></br>

### **Back-end**

## **Group project**
The CI-CD pipelines in our group project are based on a C# ASP.NET core API back-end and a JavaScript React with Node.JS front-end.

The following images display how we implemented the pipeline to make a build and deploy the build to Azure.

<br></br>
More information about the pipelines is available in the repositories mentioned in the [README.md](https://github.com/Know-Hows/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/README.md).
