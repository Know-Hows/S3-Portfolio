# **What is CI-CD?**
CI/CD, short for Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment, automates the building, testing, and deployment of the code. This accelerates the release of new features or fixes while maintaining a stable workflow and code quality.

## **What is CI?**
The acronym CI/CD has a few different meanings. The "CI" in CI/CD always refers to continuous integration, which is an automation process for developers. Successful CI means new code changes to an app are regularly built, tested, and merged to a shared repository. Itâ€™s a solution to the problem of having too many branches of an app in development at once that might conflict with each other.

## **What is CD?**
CI/CD, in software development, stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment. These terms are often used interchangeably but represent related concepts that focus on automating different stages of the software development pipeline.

Continuous delivery involves automating the process of testing and uploading a developer's changes to a code repository, such as GitHub or a container registry. These changes are then made available for deployment to a live production environment by the operations team. Continuous delivery aims to improve communication and visibility between development and business teams, ensuring that deploying new code requires minimal effort.

Continuous deployment, on the other hand, takes automation a step further by automatically releasing a developer's changes from the repository directly to the production environment, where they become accessible to customers. This approach eliminates manual processes that can slow down the delivery of software and builds upon the benefits of continuous delivery.

In summary, CI/CD encompasses both continuous delivery and continuous deployment, with the former automating the process up to the code repository and the latter automating the release of changes to the production environment for customer use. These practices streamline software development, enhance collaboration, and accelerate the delivery of new code.
