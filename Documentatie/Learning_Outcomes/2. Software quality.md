# **What is software quality?**
Software quality is defined as a field of study and practice that describes the desirable attributes of software products. There are two main approaches to software quality: defect management and quality attributes.
## **Software Quality Defect Management Approach**
A software defect can be regarded as any failure to address end-user requirements. Common defects include missed or misunderstood requirements and errors in design, functional logic, data relationships, process timing, validity checking, and coding errors.

The software defect management approach is based on counting and managing defects. Defects are commonly categorized by severity, and the numbers in each category are used for planning. More mature software development organizations use tools, such as defect leakage matrices (for counting the numbers of defects that pass through development phases prior to detection) and control charts, to measure and improve development process capability.

## **Software Quality Attributes Approach**
This approach to software quality is best exemplified by fixed quality models, such as ISO/IEC 25010:2011. This standard describes a hierarchy of eight quality characteristics, each composed of sub-characteristics:

1. Functional suitability
2. Reliability
3. Operability
4. Performance efficiency
5. Security
6. Compatibility
7. Maintainability
8. Transferability

# **Why software quality is important.**
Software quality assurance is a reliable means of producing high-quality software. There shouldn’t be much justification as to why you wouldn’t want high-quality software, but if that’s not the case consider the other reasons why improving the software quality is of the utmost importance. 

First, a high-quality software product will save you time and money. As a business, providing a good that’s worth buying is one of your primary objectives. 

If you’re building software, software quality assurance can confirm that your good, or software product, is worth buying. 

The problem with a product that is not worth buying is that you lose money making the product, and you don’t get a dime of that money back if there’s no profit earned.

To that same end, delivering a high-quality product implies less maintenance over time because your software product will be resilient in the first place. Therefore, you can spend the least amount of time and money on upkeep, if the product needs future maintenance at all.

## **Sonarcloud**
### **What is Sonarcloud?**
Sonarcloud is a cloud based code analysis service designed to detect coding issues in 26 different programming languages.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues on each merge/pull request. It it also possible to integrate sonarcloud into the Ci/Cd process.
