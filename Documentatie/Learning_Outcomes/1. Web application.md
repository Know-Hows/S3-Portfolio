# **What is a web application?**
A web application (web app) is an program that is stored on a remote server and delivered over the internet through a browser interface. Web services are web apps by definition and many, although not all, websites contain web apps.

To connect with the web app HTTP requests need to be send to acces the web app, this to retrieve, create, update, and delete data.

# **Why we implement a web application.**
We use web applications because they offer a range of advantages and benefits. This makes web apps versatile, accessible, and cost-effective, suitable for various applications, from simple tools to complex enterprise software. 

## **What are the benefits of web applications?**
Web applications have several benefits, with almost all major enterprises utilizing them as part of their user offerings. Here are some of the most common benefits associated with web apps.
1. **Accessibility**: They can be accessed from various web browsers and devices, allowing teams in different locations to access shared resources and services easily.
2. **Efficient Development**: Web app development is cost-effective and relatively straightforward, leading to shorter development cycles and cost savings. They work consistently across modern browsers and devices, eliminating the need for multiple platform iterations.
3. **User Simplicity**: Users don't need to download web apps, making them easily accessible. This eliminates the need for end-user maintenance and ensures that web apps receive automatic software and security updates, reducing the risk of security breaches.
4. **Scalability**: Businesses can easily add users without the need for additional infrastructure or costly hardware investments. Most web app data is stored in the cloud, reducing the need for additional storage capacity.

# **How we implement a web application.**
In this semester we have two major project, the individual project (IP) and the group project (GP). For both projects are we developing web applications.

## **Individual project**
For the individual project are we developing a web application with a front-end, back-end, and database. The database is hosted by MongoDB.

- ### **Front-end**:
    For the front-end we use the [React](https://react.dev/) library with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) framework.<br></br>The front-end repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Know-Hows/S3-Front-End).<br></br>
- ### **Back-end**: 
    For the back-end we use the [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) with the [ASP.NET core 6.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-6.0) framework.<br></br>The back-end repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Know-Hows/S3-Back-End).<br></br>
- ### **Database**:
    For the database we use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). With MongoDB we can host a cluster for free, this means that the database is already in the cloud. To acces the database you need a username and password in the connection string.

## **Group project**
For the group project are we developing a web application with a front-end, back-end, and database. The database is hosted by MongoDB, the back-end is getting deployed and hosted by Azure.

- ### **Front-end**
    For the front-end we use the [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/) library with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) framework.<br></br>The front-end repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Colleak/Frontend).<br></br>
- ### **Back-end**:
    For the back-end we use the [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) with the [ASP.NET core 6.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-6.0) framework.<br></br>The back-end repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Colleak/Backend-Colleak).<br></br>
- ### **Database**:
    For the database we use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). With MongoDB we can host a cluster for free, this means that the database is already in the cloud. To acces the database you need a username and password in the connection string.<br></br>
- ### **Azure**:
    When the back-end is merged on the main branch of the repository then the deployment workflow will start. The deployment builds the back-end and deploys the build to Azure. To acces the hosted back-end, the URL: https://colleak-back-end.azurewebsites.net/ can be used.
