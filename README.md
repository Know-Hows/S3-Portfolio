# Proof of learning outcomes
Semester 3 requires you to accomplish 8 learning outcomes by showing the progress and products that have been made.
| Learning outcome | Proof |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1. Web application | [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Know-Hows/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/Documentatie/Learning_Outcomes/1.%20Web%20application.md) |
| 2. Software quality | [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Know-Hows/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/Documentatie/Learning_Outcomes/2.%20Software%20quality.md) |
| 3. Agile method | [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Know-Hows/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/Documentatie/Learning_Outcomes/3.%20Agile%20method.md) |
| 4. CI/CD | [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Know-Hows/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/Documentatie/Learning_Outcomes/4.%20CI-CD.md) |
| 5. Cultural differences and ethics | [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Know-Hows/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/Documentatie/Learning_Outcomes/5.%20Cultural%20Differences%20and%20ethics.md) |

| Learning outcomes | Clarification and Outcomes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Web application:** You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications. | Started with a front and back-end, database setup. The connection between the projects has been made. |
| **Software quality:** You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development. | Started unit tests for the back-end that test the good and bad-flow the back-end controller. Implemented Sonarcloud Code Analysis that checks if the code is reliable, maintainable and secure, it also checks if their are code duplications and the unit tests code coverage. |
| **Agile method:** You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project. | Research was done on how to work with the Agile method and in groups. Scrum boards have been made for the IP and GP to work in a more controlled way. In the GP we divided the Scrum rolls like: Scrum master, contact person and note taker. |
| **CI/CD:** You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context. | Started with the Github Actions to build 2 pipelines for the back-end. The first pipeline is dedicated tothe "main" and "Dev" branch to build and test the back-end, while the second one is dedicated to only the "main" branch to build a docker image and deploy the image to docker. |
| **Cultural differences and ethics:** You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development. | Portfolio is made with how to setup the project for people outside the project. |
| **Requirements and design:** You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques. | For the IP we made a user story and for the GP we made the userstories based on the instruction we received. |
| **Business processes:** You analyze and describe simple business processes that are related to your project. | --- |
| **Professional:** You act in a professional manner during software development and learning. | We are using Jira Board (Scrum) with our backlog, current sprint and timeline. We also made a definition of done so its clear for both of us when a subject is really done. We also made a cooperation contract with a couple of rules to improve the coorperation between Lean and Meegdes. |

# Research
2 researches must also be made in semester 3, one of them has the requirement to be about security.
