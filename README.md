# Portfolio 
*By Jimmy Schuurmans and Lean Meegdes*

# KnowHows
## Description
>Learn the joy of accessible tutorials to learn more unique skills or hobbies. Everybody can share the tutorials that helped them to build a central place for learning. Users can vote to highlight better tutorials to learn from, this to help find reliable information faster.

| Learning outcomes | Clarification and Outcomes | Rating |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| **Web application:** You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications. | Made a full stack application with an entirely seperate front-end, back-end and database that could all theoretically be swapped out for alternatives which all take user experience into account by applying the outcome from a UI research that was implemented through an outsourcing project, which gave us a better understanding of potential flaws in our application. | Proficient
| **Software quality:** You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development. | Started unit tests for the back-end that test the good and bad-flow the back-end controller. Implemented Sonarcloud Code Analysis that checks if the code is reliable, maintainable and secure, it also checks if their are code duplications and the unit tests code coverage. Additionally there are also unit tests for the front-end which also connect with SonarCloud to get a detailed review of our code in the front-end. | Proficient
| **Agile method:** You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project. | Research was done on how to work with the Agile method and in groups. Scrum boards have been made for the IP and GP to work in a more controlled way. In the GP we divided the Scrum rolls like: Scrum master, contact person and note taker. We iterated on our agile process wherever possible by considering feedback whenever we got it from stakeholders or teachers to improve our process further. | Proficient
| **CI/CD:** You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context. | Started with the Github Actions to build 2 pipelines for the back-end. The first pipeline is dedicated tothe "main" and "Dev" branch to build and test the back-end, while the second one is dedicated to only the "main" branch to build a docker image and deploy the image to docker. Additionally there is also a pipeline for the front-end which functions similarly to the first pipeline of the back-end | Proficient
| **Cultural differences and ethics:** You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development. | Portfolio is made with how to setup the project for people outside the project. Additionally research was done within the group project to accomodate ethical and cultural concerns within that application and those were also included in our application as far as possible. | Proficient
| **Requirements and design:** You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques. | For the IP we made multiple user stories and for the GP we made the userstories based on the instruction we received. Additionally we made multiple diagrams displaying the structure of our individual project. | Proficient
| **Business processes:** You analyze and describe simple business processes that are related to your project. | There are a few business processes that were made for the group project that have been analyzed and approved by professionals. | Proficient
| **Professional:** You act in a professional manner during software development and learning. | We are using Jira Board (Scrum) with our backlog, current sprint and timeline. We also made a definition of done so its clear for both of us when a subject is really done. We also made a cooperation contract with a couple of rules to improve the cooperation between group members. Additionally we have each done a detailed research in a topic that could increase the overal user experience of our application. Lastly we outsourced part of our project as well as worked on 2 user stories that another group outsourced to us. | Advanced

# Designs
To wanted to get a deeper understanding of our project through making designs.

## C4 models
For the C4 models we made level 1 to 3, the 4th level we didn't include because it was to deep of a design that we needed for the project.

These models are further explained in learning outcome 6, which is "[Requirements and design](https://github.com/Know-Hows/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/Documentatie/Learning_Outcomes/6.%20Requirements%20and%20design.md#how-we-use-requirements-and-designs)".

# Research
2 researches must also be made in semester 3, one of them has the requirement to be about security.

## Security research

## UI research
